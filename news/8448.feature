Add a set of utilities in ``pip._internal.network.shallow`` for fetching metadata from remote wheel files without downloading the entire file. Link these utilities into the v2 resolver by adding a new ShallowWheelDistribution AbstractDistribution subclass. Expose this behavior via a --unstable-feature=shallow_wheels command-line option to ``pip download``. This produces a marked performance improvement.
